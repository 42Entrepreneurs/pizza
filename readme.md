One of the description of the Startup Pizza night in french.


```
Mais qu'est-ce qu'une Startup Pizza Night ?

C'est un meetup où l'on peut échanger avec des entrepreneurs, des élèves de 42 autour d'une thématique. En première partie nous donnons la parole à des experts dans le domaine, puis nous vous donnons la possibilité d'échanger plus longuement (et librement) autour de pizzas.

Cette fois ci, nous aborderons le thème de l'eSport. Si vous souhaitez pitcher, vous pouvez nous écrire sur pizza@42entrepreneurs.fr

Inscrivez vous dés maintenant à l'évent pour être tenu au courant des invités spéciaux.
```

## Planning

Pizza night are generally organized on Tuesday's. We asked between 3 - 5 CEO's or CTO's of startups to come and pitch their current problematic they are working on. (We found that when speaker speak about a problem they are facing it usually makes the speachit more interesting). Each speaker gets 10/15 mins talk and questions and anwsers from the crowd.

After that Pizza and drinks are being shared with speaker and the crowd (composed of 42 students and external people).
